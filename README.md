    ,and I will update them as I build projects in my coding career.

     necolas's Normalize.css was used to start all of my intial styling from to reset the window across all broswers and make it look homogenious across all viewports across multple sizes in mobile, and desktop view

## Wrapping Up

 This was my first project from scratch with HTML, and Css.

 #

 I used this project to reinforce my skills that I have learned with HTML, and CSS, and to learn something new, more complex than what I am used to. I pushed myself to understand the languages syntax, structure, elements, and functions.
